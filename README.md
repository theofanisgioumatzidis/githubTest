This is a project for the final exam of the "Introduction to data science and machine learning I" course, taught at the University of Crete, Physics department at the Fall of 2020.

It's a new cases prediction for the folowing week from the last date with data.
The data are from Greece while being at the end of second wave of covid.
The data are being taken directly from the www.ourworldindata.org and www.gstatic.com websites that have been updating their database ever since.
The notebook has been modified so that the used data are the ones that were availiable at the time of writing (with the option to change the last date with data).

At the time i didn't know about time series so practicly this is a try with what i knew and found in the tree days i had to write it.
